# Titanic Data-Driven Analysis using Python 

On 15 April, 1912, one of the most tragic events of the 20th century took place in the North Atlantic Ocean when the Titanic ship struck an iceberg and sank, resulting in the death of over 1500 people.

This project aims to analyse the data from the Titanic accident by addressing questions such as:
   
    1 - What was the survival rate among men, women, and children passengers?
    2 - What was the average age of survivors and non-survivors?
    3 - What was the average number of siblings and spouses on board?
    4 - What was the average fare amount by passenger class?
    5 - Did passenger class have an impact on survival rates?
    6 - What was the total number of surviving passengers by boat?
    7 - What were the top five city destinations of the survivors?
